# Hi there, welcome to Rising Sun Mental Health ðŸ‘‹

#### Hi, Iâ€™m Kathryn Satyukov, DNP, PMHNP. Iâ€™m an integrative psychiatric nurse practitioner who believes mental health care should be personalized, empowering, and go beyond just medication to create lasting change

My approach is shaped by years of nursing experience in inpatient and residential psychiatry, combined with a passion for helping teens and young adults navigate ADHD, anxiety, and depression. Iâ€™ve seen firsthand that true mental wellness isnâ€™t just about symptom reliefâ€”itâ€™s about <b>building resilience, improving daily habits, and fostering a sense of confidence and control.</b> Thatâ€™s why I combine evidence-based medication management with lifestyle strategies like <b>executive function coaching, sleep optimization, stress reduction, and nutrition.</b> My goal is to help patients not only feel better but thrive in school, relationships, and life.
